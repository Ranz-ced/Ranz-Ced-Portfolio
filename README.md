# Reflection
Making my portfolio website using GitHub Pages was a great learning experience and something I’m proud of. By following the step-by-step guide, I learned how to build and organize a website, and how to show my work in a clear way. At first, it was a bit hard to set up the repository and upload my files because I had to be careful with the file names and folder structure. But by taking my time and exploring GitHub, I was able to figure it out.

One important thing I learned was how useful version control and online publishing are. GitHub helped me keep my work safe and made it easy to share it with others. Turning on GitHub Pages and seeing my website live on the internet was very exciting. It also made me realize how important it is for a website to work well on both computers and phones.

If I could improve my portfolio, I would add more interactive features using JavaScript, make the design look better, and keep updating the projects section as I create new work. I now understand that a portfolio isn’t just a school project—it’s a way to show who I am as a developer and what I’ve learned.
# Challenges Faced and Solutions
One big challenge I faced was learning how to use GitHub correctly. I didn’t understand how repositories worked, where to put my files, or how to use Git commands like commit or push. I was worried that if I made a mistake, my site wouldn’t show up online.

To solve this, I followed the instructions closely and explored GitHub on my own. I tried uploading files using both the website and GitHub Desktop until I got more comfortable. I also paid attention to where I placed my index.html file so the site would load properly. When something didn’t work, I searched online for help and tried again until it worked.

This experience taught me that GitHub isn’t as hard as I thought. With practice and patience, I got better at using it. I now feel more confident using GitHub for future projects.
# Future Improvements
Even though my portfolio is working and online, I have a few ideas to make it better. I want to improve how it looks by using nicer colors, layouts, and animations. I also want to add fun features using JavaScript, like filtering projects and having a menu that works well on all devices.

I plan to keep updating the Projects section as I work on new things, so my portfolio always shows my latest skills. I also want to make sure my website is easy for everyone to use, by adding image descriptions, good contrast, and simple navigation.

In the future, I’d like to add a downloadable resume and a contact form so people can reach me easily. These changes will make my portfolio more professional and useful for job opportunities.
